This is an attempt to solve all of the problems from Project Euler in as many
languages as possible.

The goal is this: wherever possible, create a single source file which produces
a single interpreted script or compiled executable which when invoked from the
command line with no arguments will print the answers to each of the euler
problems in order, or, if invoked with arguments treats the arguments as
problem numbers and prints the answer to the appropriate problems.

This project accepts any contributions that produce correct results.  Fork it
and push your changes back!

It is based on work by John Evans (http://github.com/lgastako/polyeuler/),
although that project has a different purpose and will not be pulling
contributions from other users.
